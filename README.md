# Programming with Ruby

These applications were developed by Rodolfo Andrés Ramírez Valenzuela as
self practices with the programming language Ruby.

The project is divided with different folders which shows assignments and simple
Ruby exercises to demonstrate different concepts used within the language.
Within the project assignments design patterns are going to be implemented with smart
ways to resolve different problems that programmers may encounter.

The following patterns will be implented throughout the project:

  - **Template Method**
  - **Strategy objects**
  - **Observer pattern**
  - **Composite Pattern**
  - **Iterator Pattern**
  - **Adapters**
  - **Proxies**
  - **Decorator Pattern**
  - **Singleton**
  - **Factory Method**
  - **Abstract Factory**
  - **Builder Pattern**
  - **Interpreter**
