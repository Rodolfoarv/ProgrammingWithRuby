This is a quick exercise of refactoring a class based on the book **Refactoring: Ruby Edition**
by Jay Fields, Shane Harvie, Martin Fowler & Kent Beck ![](http://martinfowler.com/books/refRuby.jpg)

The following patterns are implemented in the following exercise:

- Replace Magic Number with Symbolic constant
- Rename Method
- Split Temporary Variable
- Extract Method
- Hide Method
-  Introduce Explaining Variable

- Introduce Named Parameter
- Separate Query from Modifier
- Replace Loop with Collection Closure Method
